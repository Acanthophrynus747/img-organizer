# img-organizer
A basic program to automatically organize images from my camera's SD card to folders by date.

There are two versions in the repository, one that just runs in the command line and one that opens a window with buttons to select folders. I made the latter version to get more experience with tkinter, but I like the command line version better.

I made this on my Windows 11 PC, and also used it on my windows 10 PC. No idea if it will work on any other operating system.
