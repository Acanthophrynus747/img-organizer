# img-organizer
A basic program to automatically organize images from my camera's SD card to folders by date.

When you run the program, it will pop up windows to first pick the folder to pull images from, then pick the folder to put the organized files in. It will make folders by date.

I made this on my Windows 11 PC, and also used it on my windows 10 PC. No idea if it will work on any other operating system.
